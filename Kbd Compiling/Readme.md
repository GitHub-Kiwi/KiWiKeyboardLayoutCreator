This Project was made in order to create all the files needed for a project, that then can be compiled to the driver.dll

The files of this Project are copied to the KiWi Keyboard Layout Creator. 
There they are, edited to resemble the Keyboarddriver that the user defines with the Layout Creator so that the edited kbdBlueprint project compiles to the user defined Layout.
